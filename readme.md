### Installation

Run `composer install` in the project folder. See magic.

#### Composer
In case you don't have composer installed, you really really should.

[Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/)

#### Vagrant
Run `php vendor/bin/homestead make`. You should now have a `Homestead.yaml` file in the project directory. Configure to your liking.
